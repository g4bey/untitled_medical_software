interface_patient, interface_medecin & interface_administration are the three UI I had to make for a first year project.
Feel free to compile them, heh.

This was my first time touching to Java. I had to use swing and only could only use .txt files. 

I forgot to create them in case the txt files do not exist. Sorry I'm a dummy :(
