interface_patient, interface_medecin & interface_administration 
are the three UI I had to make for my 1st semester final project.
Feel free to compile them, heh. 


This was my first time touching to Java. I had to use swing and could only use .txt files. 
I forgot to create them in case the txt files do not exist. Sorry I'm a dummy :(
